"""
    Count Number of Instances
    Create a class named User and create a way to check the number of users 
    (number of instances) that were created, so that the value can be accessed as a class attribute.

    Examples
        u1 = User("johnsmith10")
        User.user_count ➞ 1

        u2 = User("marysue1989")
        User.user_count ➞ 2

        u3 = User("milan_rodrick")
        User.user_count ➞ 3
    Make sure that the usernames are accessible via the instance attribute username.

        u1.username ➞ "johnsmith10"

        u2.username ➞ "marysue1989"

        u3.username ➞ "milan_rodrick"
